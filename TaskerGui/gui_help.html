    <h1>Help Pages for Tasker GUI</h1>
    The Tasker GUI is a tool that assists with tasking satellites. It allows you to plot satellites 
    and points on a map, determine when a satellite will be over certain coordinates, 
    calculate the orientation vector from a satellite to a point, and propogate orbits
    to different times. Further features may be added after further development.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      The Tasker GUI consists of five main parts: the Menu Bar, Button Bar, Tree, Map, and Status Bar.

      <h2>Menu Bar</h2>
      The Menu Bar has three menus: File, Tools, and Help.

        <h3>File</h3>
        The File menu has three options: Add Satellite, Add Point, and Quit. 

          <h4>Add Satellite</h4>
          Allows you to add a satellite to the Tree and plot its orbit in the Map.
          Simply select a satellite from the popup and click add. The list of satellites is gathered 
          from celestrak.com 

          <h4>Add Point</h4>
          Opens a popup that prompts you to add a point to the map. You can do this by 
          providing a name and latitude/longitude coordinates and clicking "Add."

          <h4>Quit</h4>
          Closes the TaskerGUI.

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        The Tools menu has two options: Scheduler and Pointer.

          <h4>Scheduler</h4>
          The Scheduler allows you to determine when a satellite will be over a selected point.
          A popup will appear, prompting you pick a satellite, enter a set of coordinates, give 
          a range of time to search through, and enter a tolerance. Clicking "Search" will
          search the given time range for when the satellite will be over those coordinates 
          (within the tolerance). If found, the time on the Map will be updated.

          <h4>Pointer</h4>
          The Pointer allows you to calculate the orientation vector from a satellite to a point.
          A popup will appear, prompting you to select a satellite and a point. Clicking "Calculate" 
          will calculate and display the orientation vector between the two in ECEF coordinates.

        <h3>Help</h3>
        The Help menu has two options: Version and Documentation

          <h4>Version</h4>
          Displays the current version of TaskerGUI

          <h4>Documentation</h4>
          Opens this help page in a web browser.

      <h2>Button Bar</h2>
      The Button Bar has four buttons: Set Time, Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Quit.

        <h3>Set Time</h3>
        Opens a popup that prompts you to input a time. Clicking "set" will set the 
        time plotted in the Map to the inputted time.

        <h3>Zoom In</h3>
        Enables zooming in by clicking on the map. Click again to disable.

        <h3>Zoom Out</h3>
        Enables zooming out by clicking on the map. Click again to disable.

        <h3>Quit</h3>
        Closes the TaskerGUI.

      <h2>Tree</h2>
      The Tree displays all of the satellites and points currently plotted in the map. 
      You can plot additional satellites and points using the options in the File Menu.
      Opening the drop-down for a satellite will display the two-line-element data for that satellite. 
      Opening the drop-down for a point will display the coordinates of that point.
      Clicking on a satellite or point will provide the option to remove it from the Tree and map.

      <h2>Map</h2>
      The Map displays the orbits and points displayed in the Tree. You can zoom in and out 
      by enabling the zoom in/out buttons in the Button Bar. 

      Note: This map is generated by downloading OpenStreetMap tiles and stitching them together.

      <h2>Status Bar</h2>
      The Status Bar displays the time for which the orbits in the Map are plotted. 
      You can change this time using the Set Time option in the Button Bar. The default
      when the Tasker GUI is first opened is the current UTC time.
