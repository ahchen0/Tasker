# Tasker

This was a school project that was meant to be the beginning of a satellite tasker application. However, it was not fully developed at the end of the single semester which I had to work on it. In its current state, it is capable of scraping orbital parameters of all objects currently in orbit from celestrak.com, plotting their ground tracks on a world map, and propagating their orbits to view their future locations.
